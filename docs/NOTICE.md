## Core vs Modules

### GeoLeaf Core (Open Source)

GeoLeaf Core is an open-source JavaScript mapping library. It includes:

- **Framework bootstrap** - Application initialization and configuration
- **Core mapping** - Leaflet wrapper and map management
- **Configuration system** - Configuration loading and validation
- **Logging and errors** - Unified logging and error handling
- **UI components** - Base UI system, controls, panels
- **Security** - XSS protection and input sanitization
- **Utilities** - Helper functions and utility library

**Perpetual Status**: The GeoLeaf Core library is and will remain permanently open-source under the MIT License.

### Future Modules

GeoLeaf may provide additional modules in the future that extend Core functionality. These modules may operate under different licensing models and commercial terms, **without affecting the perpetual open-source nature of the Core library**.

Any future modules will be:

- ✅ **Clearly documented** as separate, optional extensions
- ✅ **Independently licensed** with distinct terms
- ✅ **Optional additions** not required for Core operation
- ✅ **Backward compatible** with Core functionality

**Important**: Changes to future module licensing do not affect GeoLeaf Core, which remains permanently open-source under the MIT License.
