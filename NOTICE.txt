CORE vs MODULES
================================================================================

CORE (Open Source)
------------------
The GeoLeaf Core library is an open-source JavaScript mapping library released
under the MIT License. This includes:

- Framework bootstrap and initialization
- Core mapping functionality (Leaflet wrapper)
- Configuration system
- Logging and error handling
- Base UI components
- Security utilities
- Essential utilities and helpers

The Core is perpetually open source and available under the MIT License.

PREMIUM PLUGINS (Commercial License)
-------------------------------------
GeoLeaf provides optional premium plugins that extend Core functionality
under a separate commercial license:

  - GeoLeaf Storage Plugin (geoleaf-storage.plugin.js)
    Adds IndexedDB, offline tile cache, background sync, and Service Worker.
    Requires a valid commercial license.
    Commercial license required. See https://geoleaf.dev/pricing

  - GeoLeaf AddPOI Plugin (geoleaf-addpoi.plugin.js)
    Adds a full POI creation/edit/delete form with image upload and real-time
    validation. Works with or without the Storage plugin.
    Commercial license required. See https://geoleaf.dev/pricing

Two licensing models are available:
  Annual License   — updates and support included, renewed each year.
  One-Shot License — perpetual access to the purchased version; optional
                     updates available for 3 years from purchase date (N+3,
                     day for day). After N+3, a new license purchase is
                     required for updates (purchased version remains usable).

Plugins are distributed via GitHub Packages (private npm registry).
A token provided at purchase constitutes proof of active license.

These premium plugins are:
  - Sold separately from the open-source Core
  - Independently licensed under a commercial license
  - Optional additions to the Core
  - Fully backward compatible with the Core

The open-source Core (MIT) is entirely unaffected by the commercial
plugins and remains perpetually free and open source.
